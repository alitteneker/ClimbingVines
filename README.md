# ClimbingVines

This is the main repo for my (Alan Litteneker's) final project for CS275 at UCLA in the spring of 2015.

This repo has two main directories:
* ClimbingVines: This contains the main code and other assets (eg. images, geometry) required to build the project. (See below)
* Papers: This contains a copy of the final paper and presentation for the class.

In order to build this project, you will, however, need some files from the repo at:
https://github.com/alitteneker/RayTracer

Including all the files from this repo (except RayTrace.cpp) in the build path (eg. -I) will allow the code to compile successfully with g++.
